# scs

This repository is a place holder for future work implementing CITE Services in scala.  The `build.sbt` file includes a task alias so that `sbt scs` starts a service running at `http://localhost:8080/scs`.

The skeleton currently in place just builds and runs "Hello, World" level app using [finch](https://github.com/finagle/finch).
